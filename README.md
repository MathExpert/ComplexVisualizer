# ComplexVisualizer

This is a program I decided to make to both study Haxe/HaxeFlixel
and aid myself (and hopefully someone else too) in visualizing complex functions better.

Right now it doesn't do much, only shows a scalable empty graph grid, and
shows where a single hardcoded complex function (currently - `sin(a + ib)`)
maps the current cursor position to (press and hold right mouse button for that).

Hopefully, more features will be added in the future.
